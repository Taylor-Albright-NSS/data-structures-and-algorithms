INTRODUCTION TO 2D ARRAYS
_________________________

2D Array is just a nested array that forms, in mathematical terms, a matrix:

const 2sArray = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9], 
]

Templates/Creating matrixes:

1. Example of literal notation
const matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

2. Example of creating a 3x4 matrix filled with 0s
const rows = 3;
const cols = 4;
const matrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));
console.log(matrix)

3. Example of a matrix template to create 3 rows and 3 columns where row 1 = [1, 2, 3] | row 2 = [4, 5, 6] | row 3 = [7, 8, 9]
const rows = 3;
const cols = 3;
const matrix = [];

for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
  matrix[i] = [];
  for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
    matrix[i][j] = i * cols + j + 1;
  }
}
console.log(matrix)

Common Applications of 2D arrays:
Game Development: Chess checkers, tile-based or grid-based games, collision detection grids
Image processing: Scientific Computing: Pixel manipulation - Each pixel in an image can be represented as an element in a 2D array
Scientific computing: Algebra matrices, data tables, simulation grids
Graph Algorithms: ...
