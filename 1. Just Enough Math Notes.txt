*In software engineering, the most common relationship we describe is the relationship between an input size and the number of steps it takes to complete a task.*

POLYNOMIALS
___________

1. If a term has multiple exponents, you want to drop the lowest ones and keep the highest.
    Example: n^2 + n^3 = x
    - You would drop n^2 and keep n^3. The degree would be 3

Slope Intercept: y = mx + b
y = The output or dependent variable (vertical axis on the graph)
x = The input or independent variable (horizontal axis on the graph)
m = The slope (how steep the line is)
b = The y-intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis)

In the equation m = 4x + 1, you would shift the entire line up by 1 so that the line crosses at y: 1




EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS
________________________

Exponential equation: 2^x = 16
Logarithmic equation: Log2 16 = x

Base = The number an exponent is applied to. In this case, 2 is the base for both the exponential equation and logarithmic equation

To convert exponential to logarithmic, keep the base and swap the result with the exponent. In reference to 2^x = 16 and Log2 16 = x, x is the exponent and 16
    is the result in both equations.

    


COMBINATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS
_____________________________

Order Matters: Permutations

Example: ○ ○ ○   ■ ■ ■  |  In this example, we have 3 positions (squares) and 3 items (circles). We would then do...
3 x 2 x 1 = 6
There are 6 total possible permutations.

Example: ○ ○ ○ ○   ■ ■ ■  |  In this example, we have 4 items and 3 positions. We would then do...
4 x 3 x 2 = 24
There are 24 total possible permutations.

(Second example reference)
To summarize, you start with the length of the items (4) and multiply, decrementing by 1 each time, and for a total of times equal to the number of positions (3).




Repetitious Permutations

Example: Password length is 5. Total number of possible characters is 26. We would then do...
26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 = 11,881,376
(possible characters is 26 in this case because we are using each letter of the alphabet using only lowercase letters)




Order Doesn't Matter: Combinations

Example: ○ ○ ○ ○   ■ ■ ■  |  Given this, we need to calculate the permutations for the number of positions by itself and then calculate the actual permutations
    given the amount of items.
Position only permutations: 3 x 2 x 1 = 6
Actual permutations: 4 x 3 x 2 = 24
We then divide the actual permutations by the position only permutations: 24 / 6 = 4
Combinations = 4

Example 2: ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○   ■ ■ ■ ■  |  Given this, we have 4 positions and 12 items. We would then do...
Position only permutations: 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
Actual permutations: 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 = 11,880
Combinations = 495


GLOSSARY
________


Base = The number an exponent is applied to.	
Binary Search = An algorithm that finds items in sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.	
Coefficient = Any number that appears in a polynomial, either multiplied with a variable or on its own.	
Combination	= An arrangement of items in which the order of the items does not matter.	
Degree = The size of the exponent operating on a term. In a polynomial, degree refers to the largest exponent of all the terms.	
Exponent = A number written over another one indicating how many times the second number is multiplied by itself.	
Exponential Growth = Growth pattern where the output doubles or increases by a constant factor for each unit increase in input.	
Expression = A sequence of numbers, symbols, variables, and operations that can be evaluated to get a single result.	
Factorial = The product of all positive integers less than or equal to n, denoted as n!.	
Function = A mathematical relationship that maps each input to exactly one output.	
Growth Rate = How quickly a function's output increases as its input increases.	
Linear Growth = Growth pattern where quantities increase by a constant amount in each time period.	
Logarithm = The inverse operation of exponentiation; log_b(x) asks "to what power must b be raised to get x?"	
Logarithmic Growth = Growth pattern that increases slowly, characteristic of efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms.	
Permutation = An arrangement of objects where order matters.	
Polynomial = A mathematical expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and non-negative integer exponents.	
Polynomial Growth = Growth pattern described by polynomial functions (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.).	
Quadratic Growth = Growth pattern where quantities increase proportionally to the square of the input size.	
Term = A combination of coefficients and variables, or a number on its own.	
Variable = A letter or symbol that represents a numeric value that can change.
